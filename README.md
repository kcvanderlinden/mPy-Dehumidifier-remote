# mPy Dehumidifier Remote

This project is a remote control for a dehumidifier using the mPy microcontroller. It allows you to control the dehumidifier remotely using a web interface.

## Features

- Turn the dehumidifier on and off remotely
- Monitor the current humidity level (future)
- View the status of the dehumidifier (future)

## Getting Started

To get started with the mPy Dehumidifier Remote, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/kcvanderlinden/mPy-Dehumidifier-remote.git`
2. Upload code to micropython device
3. adjust the config variables (future)

## Prototype of board
